# MCP Guardian Development Plan

## Project Vision

MCP Guardian serves as a security and governance layer for AI assistants using Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides real-time visibility and control over how large language models interact with external tools and data sources. The Tauri desktop application acts as our demo centerpiece, showcasing the value and capabilities of MCP Guardian's security features in an accessible way.

## Current Status

Based on the technical discovery completed (see DISCOVERY.md), MCP Guardian consists of:

1. **Core Library**: Foundation with data models and message interception
2. **MCP Server Proxy**: Middleware for monitoring MCP traffic
3. **Desktop Application (Tauri)**: UI for configuration and message approval
4. **CLI**: Command-line management interface

## Development Focus

While the core technology will power enterprise-scale integrations, the Tauri desktop application will serve as our primary demonstration tool. UX improvements will make the application more intuitive, informative, and visually impressive without requiring deep technical knowledge.

## UX Improvement Priorities

Based on discovery findings, these areas need the most attention:

1. **Simplify Technical Complexity**: Make configuration more accessible to non-technical users
2. **Enhance Message Visualization**: Improve the presentation of tool calls and approvals
3. **Onboarding Experience**: Guide new users through setup and configuration
4. **Dashboard & Analytics**: Provide better visibility into system activity
5. **Visual Polish**: Create a more professional, cohesive appearance

## Proposed Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core UX Improvements

Focus on essential improvements to make the application more intuitive and visually appealing:

- Enhanced message visualization
- Simplified configuration interfaces
- Improved onboarding for new users
- Visual dashboard with activity metrics
- Consistent styling and component design

### Phase 2: Advanced Security Features

Expand security capabilities to better demonstrate enterprise value:

- ML-powered anomaly detection 
- Rule-based filtering with visual editor
- Enhanced audit logging and compliance reporting
- Advanced guardrailing options
- Integration with third-party security tools

### Phase 3: Enterprise Readiness

Prepare for enterprise deployment scenarios:

- Distributed deployment architecture
- High-availability configurations
- Enterprise authentication integration
- Multi-user access controls
- Performance optimizations for scale

## Implementation Approach

1. **Iterative Development**: Each phase will be broken into smaller releases
2. **User Testing**: Regular feedback cycles with representative users
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation alongside development
4. **Quality Assurance**: Thorough testing and validation for each component

## Next Steps

Before finalizing each phase plan:
1. Detail specific UX improvements with mockups
2. Prioritize features based on impact and effort
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Establish timelines and resource requirements

## Decision Process

For major feature decisions, use the following criteria:
1. Does it enhance the demo experience?
2. Does it showcase enterprise security value?
3. Is it aligned with the core security mission?
4. Can it be implemented with reasonable resources?
5. Does it add excessive complexity for users?

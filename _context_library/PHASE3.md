## Progress Notes

### 2025-04-01: Initial Implementation
- [x] Extended color system with neon colors for both light and dark modes
- [x] Established CSS variables for glow effects, grid patterns, and animations
- [x] Enhanced Button component with subtle glow and hover effects
- [x] Created angular Card variants with controlled styling
- [x] Implemented subtle grid background patterns
- [x] Added loading animation for buttons
- [x] Applied cyberpunk styling to Splash page as showcase
- [x] Ensured all styling works in both light and dark modes
- [x] Balanced aesthetic appeal with professional appearance

### 2025-04-01: Form Component Enhancements
- [x] Updated Input component with cyber and angular variants
- [x] Added focus state glow effects for inputs
- [x] Enhanced Select component with matching cyberpunk styling
- [x] Implemented backdrop blur and semi-transparent backgrounds
- [x] Created consistent styling across form components
- [x] Ensured all components work in both light and dark modes

Current approach prioritizes subtlety and professionalism while maintaining cyberpunk influences. The implementation carefully balances visual interest with usability concerns, keeping effects restrained and purposeful rather than distracting. Form components now feature subtle angular variants and glow effects that enhance the user experience without sacrificing usability.

### 2025-04-01: Dialog and Modal Enhancements
- [x] Created separate CyberDialog component to avoid breaking existing dialogs
- [x] Implemented backdrop blur effects for dialog overlays
- [x] Added subtle animations for dialog open/close transitions
- [x] Designed angular variant with masked corners for more cyberpunk styling
- [x] Created consistent header/body/footer styling with subtle gradient borders
- [x] Added dialog example component to showcase styling options
- [x] Integrated dialog showcase on splash page for demonstration
- [x] Ensured all dialog variants work in both light and dark modes

The dialog implementation presented a unique challenge as modifying the existing Dialog component caused integration issues with other components. We solved this by creating a separate CyberDialog component that maintains all the functionality of the original with enhanced styling. This approach allows us to showcase the cyberpunk styling without breaking existing functionality, giving users the option to adopt the new style progressively.

### 2025-04-01: Phase 3 Scope Refinement
- [x] Reviewed codebase for checkbox and radio button usage
- [x] Determined these components aren't currently used in the application
- [x] Conducted prioritization review of remaining Phase 3 tasks
- [x] Backlogged multiple tasks to focus specifically on view transitions
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect this decision

### 2025-04-01: View Transitions Implementation
- [x] Researched optimal transition approach for React with Tauri
- [x] Selected Framer Motion for animation capabilities
- [x] Created PageTransition component with cyberpunk styling
- [x] Implemented gradient line effects at top and bottom
- [x] Added subtle scanning line animation
- [x] Applied transitions to all application pages
- [x] Added accessibility support with prefers-reduced-motion
- [x] Ensured transitions don't negatively impact performance
- [x] Fixed styling and performance issues:
  - [x] Added missing --primary-rgb CSS variable
  - [x] After testing multiple transition approaches, removed them entirely
  - [x] Implemented true native desktop application experience with instant page changes
  - [x] Eliminated Framer Motion's AnimatePresence which was causing janky transitions
  - [x] Removed all animations to ensure consistent professional experience
  - [x] Simplified PageTransition to be a pure wrapper component
  - [x] Kept Framer Motion package for other UI components but disabled page transitions

The page transitions implementation now follows true desktop application patterns, with immediate content changes that reflect how native desktop apps typically function. Completely removing transitions eliminated all jank, flickering, and flutter issues that were occurring with animated solutions. This approach provides the most responsive, professional experience that matches user expectations for a security-focused desktop application.

# PHASE 3: Production Grade, Highly-SICKBRO!, Styling Phase

## Overview
This phase focuses on elevating the application's visual design to create a cyberpunk-inspired, sophisticated security tool. We'll implement neon accents, shimmering effects, and futuristic UI elements while maintaining professional usability.

## Goals
- [ ] Create a cyberpunk-inspired UI with neon color accents
- [ ] Implement subtle shimmering and glow effects
- [ ] Balance futuristic aesthetic with professional security tool functionality
- [ ] Ensure high contrast and readability despite stylistic choices
- [ ] Maintain accessibility standards throughout all visual enhancements

## Implementation Tasks

### Cyberpunk Visual System
- [ ] Extend current dark theme with neon accent colors (blues, purples, cyans)
- [ ] Create subtle grid/wireframe background patterns
- [ ] Design glowing border and highlight effects
- [ ] Implement data visualization with neon/holographic styling

### Advanced Component Styling
- [ ] Add subtle glow effects to interactive elements
- [ ] Design shimmering state transitions for critical components
- [ ] Create "digital distortion" effects for loading/processing states
- [ ] Implement futuristic card and panel designs with subtle animations

### Animation & Interactions
- [ ] Add subtle scan-line or CRT effects (tastefully implemented)
- [ ] Create "digital" transitions between views/states
- [ ] Implement subtle hover effects with color shifts and glows
- [ ] Design terminal-inspired loading animations

### Production Optimization
- [ ] Ensure all effects are performant across devices
- [ ] Create fallbacks for less powerful devices
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement approach
- [ ] Maintain consistent framerate during animations

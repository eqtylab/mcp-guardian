# MCP Guardian: Technical Discovery

## Project Overview

MCP Guardian is a security and governance layer for AI assistants (agents) that use the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides real-time visibility and control over how large language models interact with external tools, data sources, and APIs. It functions as a proxy between AI applications like Claude Desktop, Cursor IDE, and MCP servers.

## Technical Structure

### Components
1. **Core Library (`mcp-guardian-core`)**: Core functionality and data models
2. **MCP Server Proxy (`mcp-guardian-proxy`)**: Proxy service for MCP servers
3. **Desktop Application (`mcp-guardian`)**: Tauri-based UI for managing the system
4. **CLI (`mcp-guardian-cli`)**: Command-line interface for the system

## Detailed Analysis

### Core Library (`mcp-guardian-core`)

The core library provides the foundation for MCP Guardian with these key features:

1. **Key Data Structures:**
   - `GuardProfile`: Configurations for message interception
   - `McpServer`: MCP server configuration (cmd, args, env)
   - `ServerCollection`: Groups servers with guard profiles
   - `Message`: JSON-RPC message representation
   - `MessageInterceptorAction`: Actions on intercepted messages (Send, Drop)

2. **Message Interception:**
   - Filter by direction, type, or content
   - Chain multiple interceptors
   - Log messages for debugging
   - Manual approval mechanisms

3. **Management Functions:**
   - Guard profile management (CRUD operations)
   - MCP server management
   - Server collection management

4. **Proxy Mechanism:**
   - Sits between clients and MCP servers
   - Intercepts, inspects, and controls message flow

### MCP Server Proxy (`mcp-guardian-proxy`)

1. **Proxy Functionality:**
   - Acts as middleware between client and MCP servers
   - Launches MCP server as a child process
   - Intercepts JSON-RPC messages bidirectionally
   - Uses stdin/stdout for communication

2. **Key Features:**
   - Message interception (inbound and outbound)
   - Configurable guard profiles for message handling
   - Support for running predefined or custom MCP servers
   - Asynchronous processing with Tokio

### CLI (`mcp-guardian-cli`)

1. **Command Structure:**
   - GuardProfiles: get, set, list, delete
   - McpServers: get, set, list, delete, import
   - ServerCollections: get, set, list, delete, exportClaudeConfig, applyClaudeConfig

2. **Core Integration:**
   - Direct calls to core library functions
   - Uses core data structures

### Desktop Application (`mcp-guardian`)

1. **UI Components:**
   - Five main pages: Home, MCP Servers, Guard Profiles, Server Collections, Pending Messages
   - Expandable cards, JSON editors, confirmation dialogs
   - Toast notifications

2. **Tauri Integration:**
   - Backend passes commands to core library
   - Typed bindings for shared data structures
   - Standardized error handling

3. **Key Functionality:**
   - MCP server management
   - Guard profile configuration
   - Server collection management
   - Real-time message interception and approval
   - Tool call visualization

4. **UI/UX Patterns:**
   - Dark/light mode support
   - Expandable components
   - Consistent button styling
   - Modal dialogs
   - Real-time pending message polling
   - JSON editing with validation

## User Workflow

1. Install MCP Guardian 
2. Create MCP server configurations to connect to external tools
3. Create server collections that combine servers with guard profiles
4. Export configurations to Claude Desktop
5. Monitor and approve/deny LLM interactions with MCP servers

The system functions as a security layer that gives users control over what their LLM can access and what information gets returned from external tools.

# Business and UX Discovery

## Market Context

MCP Guardian addresses emerging security challenges in the rapid adoption of Model Context Protocol (MCP), which was launched by Anthropic in November 2024. MCP provides a standardized way for LLMs to connect with organizational data and tools, but also creates potential security vulnerabilities that need to be addressed.

## Business Value Proposition

1. **Security Control Plane**: MCP Guardian creates a security control plane between AI applications and MCP servers
2. **Complete Activity Transparency**: Provides visibility into every resource access, tool invocation, and data request
3. **Granular Request Controls**: Enables approval workflows for sensitive operations
4. **Consolidated Audit Logging**: Standardized logging of all AI agent activities
5. **Centralized Configuration Management**: Consistent security policies across multiple AI assistants

## Key Security Benefits

1. **Addressing the Security Gap**: Fills the governance gap in standard MCP implementations
2. **Preventing Unmonitored Access**: Provides visibility into AI assistants accessing sensitive data
3. **Enabling Governance**: Enforces "human-in-the-loop" requirements for sensitive operations
4. **Providing Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for security investigations and compliance reporting
5. **Managing Privileges**: Helps manage appropriate access levels across multiple MCP servers

## Target User Base

1. **Enterprise Security Teams**: Organizations deploying AI with security requirements
2. **Compliance Officers**: Those who need audit trails of AI system actions
3. **AI Governance Teams**: Groups responsible for oversight of AI deployments
4. **Knowledge Workers**: End users who need secure AI-assisted workflows

## Specific Use Cases

1. **Securing Claude Desktop Tool Access**:
   - Monitor file system interactions, document processing APIs, database queries
   - Block PII access
   - Enable compliance-compatible document analysis

2. **Securing Cursor IDE Tool Integration**:
   - Secure access to Git repositories, code analysis tools, build systems
   - Block credential exposure
   - Enforce license compliance

3. **Securing Multi-System Enterprise Tools**:
   - Provide unified audit trails
   - Maintain security boundaries
   - Enable secure automation with control

## Strategic Vision

MCP Guardian is positioned as part of a broader evolution toward "agents guarding agents" - using AI capabilities as a security layer while maintaining human oversight. While MCP Guardian itself is not an agent, the roadmap includes the ability to integrate agents as guardrails, recognizing that as AI workflows grow more complex, traditional security methods alone become insufficient.

## UX Analysis

### UI Organization and Flow

3. **MCP Servers Page**: Manage server configurations
4. **Guard Profiles Page**: Configure security policies
5. **Server Collections Page**: Group servers with profiles
6. **Pending Messages Page**: Real-time approval interface

### Key Interaction Patterns

1. **Entity Management**:
   - Consistent expand/collapse cards for all entities
   - JSON editing with validation
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

2. **Message Approval Workflow**:
   - Real-time polling for pending messages
   - Clear approve/deny actions
   - Formatted display of tool calls and responses

3. **Configuration Export**:

3. **Error Recovery**: Limited guidance on fixing configuration issues
4. **Setup Complexity**: Multistep process to get started

## Technical Architecture Considerations

The application is engineered for enterprise-scale deployment, built in Rust for performance and security. Its architecture supports both simple desktop deployments and complex distributed environments where AI agents operate across multiple systems and data centers.

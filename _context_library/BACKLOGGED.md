# Backlogged Features & Improvements

This document tracks features and improvements that have been deprioritized from current phases and moved to future development cycles. Each entry includes a rationale for backlogging and tentative phase assignment.

## Phase 2 Backlogged Items

### Responsive Header Optimization
- **Original Phase:** Phase 2
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 3
- **Rationale:** While the current header implementation works well for standard desktop sizes, additional optimization for smaller screens would improve the mobile experience. Backlogged due to budget constraints in Phase 2.
- **Details:**
  - Create mobile-specific layout for header navigation
  - Implement collapsible menu for small screens
  - Adjust spacing and text size for better mobile readability
  - Test across standard mobile breakpoints

### Advanced Theme Accessibility
- **Original Phase:** Phase 2
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 3
- **Rationale:** Basic accessibility is implemented through Radix UI primitives, but more comprehensive testing and improvements would enhance the application for all users. Backlogged due to time constraints.
- **Details:**
  - Conduct comprehensive contrast testing in both themes
  - Enhance keyboard navigation patterns
  - Improve focus state visibility
  - Add additional ARIA attributes for theme-specific elements

### Component-Specific Theme Refinements
- **Original Phase:** Phase 2
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 3
- **Rationale:** While core components work in both themes, some edge cases and component combinations could benefit from theme-specific adjustments. Backlogged to focus on delivering core functionality.
- **Details:**
  - Review and refine all form component dark mode styles
  - Enhance data visualization components in dark mode
  - Create theme-specific adjustments for complex UI patterns
  - Address edge cases for component combinations

### Theme Transition Performance
- **Original Phase:** Phase 2
- **Tentative New Phase:** Future optimization
- **Rationale:** Current theme transitions work but could be optimized for performance on lower-end devices. Backlogged as the current implementation meets basic requirements.
- **Details:**
  - Optimize CSS transition properties for better performance
  - Consider hardware acceleration for smoother animations
  - Reduce transition flash on initial page load
  - Explore selective transitions for critical elements only

## UI & Component Library

### Accessibility Audit
- **Original Phase:** Phase 1 Interject
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 2
- **Rationale:** While accessibility is important, the Radix UI primitives already provide strong baseline accessibility. A full audit can be conducted after core functionality is complete.
- **Details:**
  - Comprehensive review of components for accessibility issues
  - Automated testing with tools like Axe or Lighthouse
  - Screen reader testing (NVDA, VoiceOver)
  - Documentation of accessibility features

### Component Unit Tests
- **Original Phase:** Phase 1 Interject
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 2
- **Rationale:** The component library is functioning well in actual usage. Unit tests will provide additional quality assurance but can be implemented after core application features are complete.
- **Details:**
  - React Testing Library implementation
  - Interaction testing (clicks, keyboard navigation)
  - Verification of accessibility attributes
  - Test coverage targets

### Error Handling Improvements
- **Original Phase:** Phase 1
- **Tentative New Phase:** Phase 2
- **Rationale:** The basic error handling functionality works well, but more detailed error messages and recovery suggestions would be enhancements rather than critical fixes.
- **Details:**
  - Create more descriptive error messages
  - Add recovery suggestions for common errors
  - Create error code reference system
  - Implement contextual error handling

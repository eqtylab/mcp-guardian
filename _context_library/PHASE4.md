3. Has already had significant discovery work completed
4. Will set patterns for other aspects of the Phase 4 implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Key UX Principles

1. **Visual First Approach**
   - Visual interfaces should be the default mode for all configuration screens
   - JSON editing should be available but as an opt-in "advanced mode"
   - All functionality must be accessible through visual interfaces without requiring JSON knowledge

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with simple, focused interfaces for common tasks
   - Reveal advanced options and configurations only when needed
   - Provide clear indicators when advanced options are being used

3. **Guidance Without Obstruction**
   - Provide helpful guidance and suggestions
   - Don't block experienced users with overly simplistic workflows
   - Allow for both guided and direct manipulation

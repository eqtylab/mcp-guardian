## Priority Matrix

| Feature | Impact | Complexity | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|------------|----------|-------|
| Visual Guard Profile Builder | High | High | 1 | Leading priority with preliminary discovery completed |
| Form-based editors | High | Medium | 2 | |
| Templates | High | Low | 2 | |
| Server Collection Diagram | Medium | High | 3 | Will be informed by Guard Profile Builder approach |
| Guided Wizards | High | Medium | 3 | |
| Enhanced Message Approval | High | Medium | 4 | |
| Quick Actions | Medium | Low | 5 | |

The Guard Profile Visual Builder is our highest priority despite its complexity. This component:
1. Will create the most high-value demo for stakeholders
2. Will guide the design approach for other visual components
3. Has already had significant discovery work completed
4. Will set patterns for other aspects of the Phase 4 implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Key UX Principles

1. **Visual First Approach**
   - Visual interfaces should be the default mode for all configuration screens
   - JSON editing should be available but as an opt-in "advanced mode"
   - All functionality must be accessible through visual interfaces without requiring JSON knowledge

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with simple, focused interfaces for common tasks
   - Reveal advanced options and configurations only when needed
   - Provide clear indicators when advanced options are being used

3. **Guidance Without Obstruction**
   - Provide helpful guidance and suggestions
   - Don't block experienced users with overly simplistic workflows
   - Allow for both guided and direct manipulation

#### 2025-04-02: JSON Schema System Implementation Completed

The JSON Schema System for MCP Guardian has been successfully implemented, providing a solid foundation for enhanced JSON editing with validation and autocompletion:

- **Creation of mcp-guardian-schema Package**:
  - Implemented a dedicated Rust package for JSON Schema generation
  - Added workspace integration for seamless development workflow
  - Created JSON Schema generation for all core entity types
  - Implemented CLI tool with commands for generating and exporting schemas
  - Added tests to verify schema correctness

- **Core Integration**:
  - Added JsonSchema derives to all core types in mcp-guardian-core
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
  - Ensured non-invasive changes that don't affect runtime behavior
  - Added schema versioning for better compatibility tracking

- **Frontend Integration Preparation**:
  - Created directory structure for Monaco Editor integration
  - Exported generated schemas to frontend location
  - Prepared example integration code for Monaco Editor
  - Added comprehensive documentation for frontend developers

- **Documentation**:
  - Created comprehensive schema system documentation in `/docs/src/schema_system.md`
  - Enhanced existing PHASE4 documentation with updated implementation status
  - Documented CLI usage with examples
  - Created guidelines for maintaining schema compatibility

This implementation lays the groundwork for the Monaco Editor integration, which will be the next step in enhancing the JSON editing experience. The schema system ensures that changes to Rust data models automatically flow through to the frontend validation, maintaining a single source of truth throughout the application.

#### 2025-04-02: Monaco Editor Integration Initiated

Building on the JSON Schema System implementation, we've begun integrating Monaco Editor for enhanced JSON editing:

- **Monaco Editor Setup**:
  - Installed Monaco Editor dependencies (`@monaco-editor/react` and `monaco-editor`)
  - Created dedicated Monaco-based JSON editor components in `/components/json-editor/`
  - Implemented schema-based validation and autocompletion
  - Added robust error handling and formatting capabilities

- **Component Implementation**:
  - Created `MonacoJsonEditor` component with schema validation
  - Implemented enhanced `JsonViewer` component for read-only display
  - Developed schema utilities for Monaco integration
  - Added theming support to match application styles

- **Schema Integration**:
  - Configured Monaco to use JSON Schema validation
  - Implemented functionality to load and apply schemas
  - Created utilities to select appropriate schema by entity type
  - Set up foundations for schema-based documentation tooltips

- **Initial Component Replacement**:
  - Updated MCP Server component to use Monaco-based editor
  - Replaced legacy JSONViewer with Monaco-based version in tool-call component
  - Maintained consistent API for seamless integration
  - Enhanced UX with better formatting and validation feedback

This initial Monaco Editor integration provides significant UX improvements including:
- Syntax highlighting
- Schema validation
- Error highlighting and messages
- Improved code formatting
- Copy functionality
- Better visual design

The implementation follows the migration plan outlined in PHASE4_JSONMIGRATION.md and will continue with full replacement of all JSON editing components in the application.

*Additional notes will be added as implementation progresses with decisions and lessons learned.*

# Phase 1: UI Polish & Subtle UX Improvements

## Overview

This phase focuses on refining the existing MCP Guardian Tauri application primarily through visual polish and subtle UX improvements. We'll enhance the application's visual presentation and address minor friction points in the current user experience, while keeping code changes minimal and focused (like renaming files to kebab-case). This work will establish a more polished foundation for the demo centerpiece.

## Goals

1. **Visual Polish**: Enhance the application's visual design with consistent styling and professional appearance
2. **UX Refinements**: Make subtle but meaningful improvements to existing interfaces
3. **Minimal Code Cleanup**: Implement simple cleanup like file naming consistency without major refactoring

## Task Categories

### 1. Visual Polish

  - Refine button styles (primary, secondary, danger actions)
  - Create consistent form element styling

- [ ] **Visual Feedback Enhancements**
  - Improve loading states and indicators
  - Enhance toast notifications with better positioning and styling
  - Add subtle animations for state transitions

### 2. UX Refinements

- [ ] **Navigation Improvements**
  - Enhance keyboard shortcut visibility
  - Improve navigation feedback and active states
  - Add breadcrumbs for nested interfaces

  - Add helper text for technical configuration options

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Create more descriptive error messages
  - Add recovery suggestions for common errors
  - Improve error visualization in the UI

### 3. Minimal Code Cleanup

- [ ] **File Naming Consistency**
  - Rename component files to kebab-case
  - Ensure utility files follow camelCase convention
  - Update imports to match new naming

- [ ] **Basic Documentation**
  - Add simple comments to explain complex UI logic
  - Document component props with basic descriptions
  - Create README updates for new conventions

## Implementation Approach

1. **Audit First**: Begin with a visual UI audit to identify inconsistencies
2. **Quick Wins**: Implement high-impact, low-effort improvements first
3. **Minimal Disruption**: Make changes that don't require significant refactoring
4. **Visual-First**: Focus on changes that enhance visual appeal and usability

## Success Criteria

- Visually consistent application with professional appearance
- More intuitive interfaces with subtle UX improvements
- Consistent file naming following established conventions
- Strong visual foundation for demonstrating MCP Guardian's value

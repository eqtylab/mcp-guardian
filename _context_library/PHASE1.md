# Phase 1: UI Polish & Subtle UX Improvements

## Overview

This phase focuses on refining the existing MCP Guardian Tauri application primarily through visual polish and subtle UX improvements. We'll enhance the application's visual presentation and address minor friction points in the current user experience, while keeping code changes minimal and focused (like renaming files to kebab-case). This work will establish a more polished foundation for the demo centerpiece.

# Phase 1: UI Polish & Subtle UX Improvements

## Overview

This phase focuses on refining the existing MCP Guardian Tauri application primarily through visual polish and subtle UX improvements. We'll enhance the application's visual presentation and address minor friction points in the current user experience, while keeping code changes minimal and focused (like renaming files to kebab-case). This work will establish a more polished foundation for the demo centerpiece.

## Goals

1. **Visual Polish**: Enhance the application's visual design with consistent styling and professional appearance
2. **UX Refinements**: Make subtle but meaningful improvements to existing interfaces
3. **Minimal Code Cleanup**: Implement simple cleanup like file naming consistency without major refactoring

## Implementation Notes

### 2023-05-01

- Completed initial color system implementation with cybersecurity focus
- Established semantic token naming for better maintainability
- Added utility classes for layout and spacing
- Fixed critical dialog transparency issues with solid background colors
- Created comprehensive documentation in STYLING_GUIDE.md and CLAUDE.md
- Enhanced styling for message visualization with proper syntax highlighting
- Improved space efficiency throughout the interface

### 2023-05-15

- Conducted audit of current CSS implementation and Tailwind usage
- Identified opportunities to leverage Tailwind v4 more effectively:
  - Can configure Tailwind directly in App.css without a separate config file
  - Many custom CSS classes can be replaced with Tailwind utility combinations
  - Need to leverage Tailwind v4's direct CSS variable integration
  - Currently not using Tailwind v4's automatic optimization features
- Planned migration path that preserves current design system while improving maintainability
- Prepared documentation and examples for consistent Tailwind patterns across app

### 2023-05-18

- Implemented Tailwind CSS v4 configuration in App.css using @config directive
- Converted all CSS variables to use Tailwind's theme() function
- Maintained same visual design while modernizing the CSS approach
- Refactored McpServerComponent to use Tailwind utility classes
- Added comments to guide developers toward utility classes over custom classes
- Created patterns for buttons, cards, and form elements using utility compositions

### 2023-05-20

- Refactored GuardProfileComponent to use Tailwind utility classes
- Refactored ServerCollectionComponent to use Tailwind utility classes
- Implemented consistent button styling patterns across components
- Established reusable patterns for card headers, content areas, and button groups
- Replaced custom CSS classes with utility compositions while maintaining visual design

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining in-progress items:

# Phase 1: UI Polish & Subtle UX Improvements

## Overview

This phase focuses on refining the existing MCP Guardian Tauri application primarily through visual polish and subtle UX improvements. We'll enhance the application's visual presentation and address minor friction points in the current user experience, while keeping code changes minimal and focused (like renaming files to kebab-case). This work will establish a more polished foundation for the demo centerpiece.

## Goals

1. **Visual Polish**: Enhance the application's visual design with consistent styling and professional appearance
2. **UX Refinements**: Make subtle but meaningful improvements to existing interfaces
3. **Minimal Code Cleanup**: Implement simple cleanup like file naming consistency without major refactoring

- Used semantic class organization with helpful comments for better readability

## Next Steps

1. Continue CSS optimization process:

   - Refactor remaining dialog components (CreateServerCollectionDialog, CreateGuardProfileDialog, ClaudeExportModal)
   - Focus next on any components using btn-* classes, which should be converted to Tailwind utilities
   - After all component-specific styles are removed, identify and clean up unused CSS in App.css
   - Update component examples in STYLING_GUIDE.md with best practices from refactored components

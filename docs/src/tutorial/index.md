# Tutorial

The heard of MCP Guardian is the proxy application that allows for monitoring an authorization of communications between the AI agent and MCP servers, but to make configuration and usage of the proxy easier, a CLI and GUI app are provided. The CLI and GUI have the same functionality so you can use whichever one is easier for you.

Make sure you've completed the [installation](../installing/index.md) steps for your system, then [create an mcp server](./create_mcp_server.md), some [guard profiles](./create_guard_profile.md) and finally a [server collection](./create_server_collection.md) that can be exported to Claude Desktop.

# MCP Guardian

## Overview

MCP Guardian enables visibility and control over all of an AI agent's MCP-based activity.

MCP Guardian does not have to be deeply integrated into an AI agent's host application. It can simply proxy MCP traffic from a closed host like [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) to provide additional visibility and granular control to the host's activity.

## MCP Guardian Desktop Portal

MCP Guardian's desktop portal facilitates management of proxy configurations, visibility to logs, and a UI showing status of automated gate checks and manual control of outbound and inbound MCP messages.

## MCP Guardian Proxy

MCP Guardian can be configured to proxy any number of MCP servers. For each MCP server proxied with MCP guardian you can configure
- MCP message logging
- MCP message gate checks
  - Automated: scan messages with built in guards or custom logic extensions
  - Manual: approve and deny individual messages in real time
